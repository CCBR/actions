You will need the GitHub CLI installed
(this is pre-installed on all github actions runners):
<https://github.com/cli/cli#installation>

Then install the `ccbr_actions` package with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CCBR/actions
```

Or install it from a specific version or branch with:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CCBR/actions@v0.1
```
