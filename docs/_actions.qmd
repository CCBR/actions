See example workflows that use our custom actions here:
<https://github.com/CCBR/actions/tree/main/examples>.
You can copy these to your own repository in the `.github/workflows/` directory
and modify them for your needs.

View the [GitHub Actions docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more
information on how to write and use GitHub Actions workflows.
