GitHub Actions for CCBR repos

[![build](https://github.com/CCBR/actions/actions/workflows/build-python.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CCBR/actions/actions/workflows/build-python.yml)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/CCBR/actions/graph/badge.svg?token=yCtBbX4tap)](https://codecov.io/gh/CCBR/actions)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.13761059.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13761059)

## Examples

See [examples/](examples) for workflow examples.
You can copy these to your own repository in the `.github/workflows/` directory
and modify them for your needs.

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
import pathlib
for path in sorted(pathlib.Path('examples').glob('*.yml')):
    print(f"- [{path.stem}]({path})")
```


## Actions

Custom actions used in our github workflows.

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
import yaml
for action_yml in sorted(pathlib.Path().glob("*/action.yml")):
    with action_yml.open('r') as infile:
        action_meta = yaml.load(infile, Loader = yaml.FullLoader)
    name = action_meta['name']
    desc = action_meta['description']
    print(f"- [{name}]({action_yml.parent}) - {desc}")

```

## Package

This repo contains a python package with helper functions for some of our
custom actions.
You do not need to install anything in order to use the example workflows,
as the actions install their dependencies as needed.
However, you can install the package if you wish to use it outside of GitHub Actions.

### Installation

You will need the GitHub CLI installed
(this is pre-installed on all github actions runners):
https://github.com/cli/cli#installation

Then install the `ccbr_actions` package with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CCBR/actions
```

Or install it from a specific version or branch with:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CCBR/actions@v0.1
```
