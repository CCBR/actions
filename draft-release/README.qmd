# draft-release

```{python}
import ccbr_actions.docs

action = ccbr_actions.docs.parse_action_yaml('action.yml')
print(ccbr_actions.docs.action_markdown_desc(action))
```

This action helps create a draft release based on the contents of the changelog and commit history.
It is designed to be used in a manually triggered workflow to draft a release.

This action checks out the latest commit in the branch you run the workflow from,
updates files (including `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`, `CITATION.cff`, and `codemeta.json`),
and then creates a draft release with the new version and changelog entry.

After the workflow completes, navigate to the Releases page on GitHub and ensure
everything looks correct, then publish the release when you're ready.

## Usage

Input files:

- `CHANGELOG.md` - a changelog or news file with entries in reverse chronological order. The newest entry should contain a header with the phrase “development version”.
- `VERSION` - a single-source version file.
- `CITATION.cff` - a citation file. (optional)

When you're ready to draft a new release,
[run the workflow manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow). After the workflow completes, there will be a new draft release that you can review and choose to publish.

### Basic example

[draft-release.yml](/examples/draft-release.yml)


```{python}
yml_file='../examples/draft-release.yml'
print('```yaml')
with open(yml_file, 'r') as infile:
  print(infile.read())
print('```\n')
```
