import ccbr_actions.docs

action = ccbr_actions.docs.parse_action_yaml('action.yml')
print(ccbr_actions.docs.action_markdown_header(action))
```

This action helps create a draft release based on the contents of the changelog and commit history.
It is designed to be used in a manually triggered workflow to draft a release.
The latest commit in the branch you run the workflow from will be used as the target for the release tag.

## Usage

Required files:

- `CHANGELOG.md` - a changelog or news file with entries in reverse chronological order. The newest entry should contain "development header".
- `VERSION` - a single-source version file.
- `CITATION.cff` - a citation file.

### Basic example

[draft-release.yml](examples/draft-release.yml)


```{python}
yml_file='../examples/draft-release.yml'
print('```yaml')
with open(yml_file, 'r') as infile:
  print(infile.read())
print('```\n')
```


### Customized inputs

```yaml
TODO
```

```{python}
print(ccbr_actions.docs.action_markdown_io(action))
```
