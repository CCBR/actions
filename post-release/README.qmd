```{python}
import ccbr_actions.docs

action = ccbr_actions.docs.parse_action_yaml('action.yml')
print(ccbr_actions.docs.action_markdown_header(action))
```

This action is designed to be triggered by publishing a release.
On completion, it will open a pull request to merge post-release clean up chores
such as bumping the developemnt version in the version file and changelog.
It works best when used in conjunction with [`draft-release`](/draft-release) to help automate parts of the release process.

## Usage

Required files:

- `CHANGELOG.md` - a changelog or news file with entries in reverse chronological order. The newest entry should contain "development header".
- `VERSION` - a single-source version file.
- `CITATION.cff` - a citation file.


### Basic example

[post-release.yml](post-release.yml)

```{python}
yml_file='../examples/post-release.yml'
print('```yaml')
with open(yml_file, 'r') as infile:
  print(infile.read())
print('```\n')
```


### Customized inputs

```yaml
TODO
```

```{python}
print(ccbr_actions.docs.action_markdown_io(action))
```
